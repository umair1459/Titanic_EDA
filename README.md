# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualization

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Visualization on the Titanic dataset.  
The goal is to identify key patterns such as survival rate by gender, passenger class, age groups, etc.  

##  Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas   
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

##  Key Insights
- Female passengers had higher survival rates.  
- Passengers in higher classes (1st class) had better chances of survival.  
- Younger passengers survived more compared to older ones.
